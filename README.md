Picatrix is a framework that is meant to be used within a [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) or
[Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks. The framework is designed around
providing a security analyst with the libraries to develop helper functions
that will be exposed as magics and regular python functions in notebooks.

This makes it easier to share an environment with other analysts, exposing
common functions that are used in notebooks to everyone. In addition to that
the functions themselves are designed to make it easier to work with various
APIs and backends in a notebook environment. The functions mostly involve
returning data back as a pandas DataFrame for further processing or to work
with pandas (manipulate pandas, change values, enrich data, upload data frames
to other services, etC).

## Howto Get Started

Read the [installation instructions](docs/Installation.md) on the best ways
to install picatrix.

After installing, connect to the Jupyter notebook in your web browser (should open
up automatically). Inside the notebook you need to import the picatrix library
and initialize it:

```
from picatrix import notebook_init
notebook_init.init()
```

(if you are using the docker container you don't need to import these libraries,
that is done for you automatically).

And that's it, then all the magics/helper functions are now ready and accessible
to your notebook. To get a list of the available helpers, use:

```
%picatrixmagics
```

Or

```
picatrixmagics_func()
```

Each magic has a `--help` parameter or the functions with `_func?`. Eg.

```
timesketch_set_active_sketch_func?
```
