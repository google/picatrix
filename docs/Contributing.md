# How to Contribute

We'd love to accept your patches and contributions to this project. There are
just a few small guidelines you need to follow.

## Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License
Agreement. You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your contribution;
this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions as
part of the project. Head over to <https://cla.developers.google.com/> to see
your current agreements on file or to sign a new one.

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one
(even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it
again.

## Code reviews

To keep the code base maintainable and readable all code is developed using a similar coding style. See the [style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html). This makes the code easier to maintain and understand.

The purpose of the code review is to ensure that:

 * at least two eyes looked over the code in hopes of finding potential bugs or errors (before they become bugs and errors). This also improves the overall code quality.
 * make sure the code adheres to the style guide.
 * review design decisions and if needed assist with making the code more optimal or error tolerant.

We use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult
[GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more
information on using pull requests.

**The short version:**

*don't be intimidated.*

**The longer version:**

One language is not the same as another, you might be fluent in C or Perl, but that does not mean the same fluency for Python. You might have just started programming while others have been doing this for years. Our challenge is having a code base that is accessible and sufficiently uniform to most of you.

Also don't be intimidated by rewrites/refactors, which can make it feel like the code base is changing under your feet. We have to make sure the code base is maintainable and this involves regular reshaping and cleaning up to get new features in.

We continuously try to improve the code base, including making things and easier and quicker to write. This sometimes means that the way you just learned might already superseded by another. We try to keep the documentation up to date but this will sometimes be after you ran into an issue.

First time contributors may come across the fact that the code review process can take quite a long time, with lots of back and forth comments. You may think that you are wasting the core developers time, but rest assured you are not. We look at this as an investment of building up good solid code contributors. We want to make sure our contributors understand the code and the style guide and will make suggestions to the contributor to fix what we think needs improving. Despite spending potentially more time to begin with to get code submitted into the project we believe this investment in code review will result in better code submissions and increased proficiency of the contributor.

Therefore we would like to ask people to hang on, to get through the code review process and try to learn something while going through it. Rest assured, it will get easier next time and even easier the time after that, and before you know it you can contribute code to the project with little to no comments.

And if things are unclear, don't hesitate to ask. You can also join the slack channel [here](http://join-open-source-dfir-slack.herokuapp.com/), the channel for picatrix is #picatrix.
