        "Python is an interpreted language, with the python interpreter executing one statement at a time. For data science, and for the purposes here we use IPython, which is an enhanced python interpreter. You can run this intepreter many ways, including by using Jupyter or Colab. Jupyter and Colab have a web based interface to run Python code in a notebook, which this here is. A notebook is a type of interactive document for code. It is a mix of text cells and code cells, where the text can be formatted in markdown and the code depends on the interpreter that is attached to it (here we will use python).\n",
